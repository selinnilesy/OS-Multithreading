Drone Simulation homework of CENG334, June 2021 <br />

Hubs contain charging spaces for drones and incoming/outgoing storage spaces for senders and receivers. <br />
Senders can deposit and receivers can take their delivery while drones are depositing packages to them simultaneously.  <br />
Also drones are allowed to be called from idle hubs in addition to being assigned to a package by its hub. <br />
Note: Simulator.cpp contains all the member functions of simulation classes being written in a short time. <br />
Some of the functions also implement the same functionalities of simulator multiple times for debugging purposes and remained that way afterwards, due to lack of time.
